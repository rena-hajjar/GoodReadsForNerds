# Good Reads (but my version which is way better)

### For my own enjoyment, a place where I can keep my book status, as well as my notes on specific chapters (I have a lot to say)
- Built with a Spring Boot backend and React frontend
- First time creating a RESTful API!
- Eventually, I want it to be more of a book club social media

## To run this program
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the `SpringBootApplicationDemo` class in the `backend` folder
3. Run `npm start` in the `frontend` folder

  ## TO DO
  - [ ] Add book element for main page list
  - [ ] Finish book model and controller
  - [ ] Ability to update database from the frontend
  - [ ] Figma design so not ugly anymore
  - [ ] Clickable books
  - [ ] Date started/finished
  - [ ] Colour coordinated statuses
  - [ ] User accounts
  - [ ] Ratings of books
  - [ ] Customizable tags
  - [ ] Filter by tag/status
